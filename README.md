# 🌷Hi, I'm Alistair! 
<br>
☕ Just a tired cs student trying to survive with ctrl + c and coffee  </br>
🫠 I don’t build that many projects... but I *do* open VS Code sometimes </br>

<br>

### About me 
👩🏻‍💻 Currently Studying Computer Science </br>
💗 Learning at my own pace (mostly when deadlines hit) </br>
😮‍💨 Slow and steady coder, but i get there eventually </br>

<br>

### Currently
🫶 Navigating my way through this course (slowly, but surely)  </br>
🥱 Emotionally 50/50 about CS... depends on the day </br>
🦑 Always *thinking* about building something... just not *actually* doing it 😁
